Develop an application that enables the user to generate either a Christmas, Wedding, or Birthday Greeting card.  The application should create objects of either type Christmas, Wedding or Birthday with parameters for recipient and sender. 

Each card should comprise each of the following methods: 

initialise() – to  initialise arrays of predefined salutations, verses and closings dependent on the type of card 

salutation() – to choose a random salutation from the array and print alongside the recipient name  

verse() – to choose and print a random verse from the array  

closing() – to choose a random closing from the array and print alongside the sender name
